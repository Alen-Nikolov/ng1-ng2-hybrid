# UpgradeModule with Angular/AngularJS

***Note:*** *I had to retroactively update the `bower.json` file to include fixed versions for `angular-animate`, `angular-aria`, and
`angular-messages` due to an issue with some updated packages, so they appear as a part of every step comparison :(*

*There was also a memory leak in the `pureAngularjs` component which is not fixed in steps 1-5, fix is addressed
[here](/../../../pull/11/files#diff-dc0248ff1bd622babf1fed7c5f2800b1)*
